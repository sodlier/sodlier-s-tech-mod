# Sodlier's Tech Mod

This is just a mod where i put my insanity in minecraft

Mod is for **Forge 1.7.10**

## Build from source
If you want to get the full newest version of the mod (when i don't add a new release) you can follow the guide

1. Have JDK8, to check you can do `java -version` on your command line to check, output should show something like ```openjdk version "1.8"``` if not you can install it from [here](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8&jvmVariant=hotspot)

2. Have Git installed, to check do `git --version` on your command line, if you get any output it means you have git installed

3. Use Git Bash if you are on Windows, if on Linux you can just open your terminal

4. Find the directory you want the folder of the repo to be in

5. Run ```git clone https://github.com/sodlier/sodlier-s-tech-mod.git``` to clone the repo

6. Go inside the folder ```cd sodlier-s-tech-mod```

7. Run ```./gradlew build``` to build the mod

8. Go inside the folder with your file explorer and go inside `build/libs` and get the `stm-(version).jar`, that is your mod file

This mod was somewhat inspired by [HBM's Nuclear tech mod](https://github.com/HbmMods/Hbm-s-Nuclear-Tech-GIT), very cool mod
